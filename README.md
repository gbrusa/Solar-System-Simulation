# Solar System Simulation

Originally this was going to be the basis for a Space Colonization game. However, I was unable to complete the implementation before the end of the Ludum Dare Game Jam competition. Therefore, I completed the simulation and left the remainder of the game unfinished.

The simulation is to-scale and factors in rotational velocities and sizes relative to Earth's.
