# Solar System Simulation
A simple solar system simulation that was intended to be part of a game involving space conquest. The simulation is to-scale and factors in rotational velocities and sizes relative to those of Earth.

### Technologies
* C#
* Unity

### TODO
* Adjust the distances from the sun (probably change scale) so that everything is viewable in one screen
  * Could also try allowing user to move camera/zoom in to different planets
* Produce .exe of the code for easy viewing
